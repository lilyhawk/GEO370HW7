<h3>Reasoning</h3>

    <p>I chose to show the sampling results of GenX because it's what interests me. I am from Wilmington, NC and the PFAS pollution of the Cape Fear River is what made me major in environmental studies. Last semester I worked closes with CleanCapeFear fighting for water quality so I am very familiar with the data I used for the map. This was a new way for me to analyze and present this data. </p>

<p>I presented the information as a proportional symbol map since the data dealt with pollution at certain points. </p>
